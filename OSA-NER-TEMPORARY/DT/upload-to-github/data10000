 The arrests occurred Friday in <ADDRESS_start>Marga-von-Etzdorf-Straße 210<ADDRESS_end> .

 A six-party coalition of religious based parties , the Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal , dominates the provincial assembly , so the bill was easily passed Thursday by a vote of 68-34 .
 The provincial governor must still sign the bill before it becomes law , a step seen only as a formality .
 The proposed law calls for setting up a " religious police force " to make sure people adhere to Islamic values in public places , and entertainment outlets close during weekly Friday prayers .

 Representatives from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Advisory Council are holding meetings this week to finalize their annual report for APEC leaders who will hold a summit on September 8 and 9 .
 VOA 's Nancy-Amelia Collins reports from <ADDRESS_start>Johann-Georg-Straße 258, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> .
 Energy , security , climate change , the World Trade Organization 's stalled negotiations , and investment are all expected to be among the major topics in the annual report of the APEC Business Advisory Council , known as ABAC .
 Tim Harcourt , the chief economist of the Australian Trade Commission , says ABAC plays an important role by informing governments where there are problems .
 " The most important thing the business groups can do is to tell the governments where there are logjams , where there are obstacles , where things can improve , " Harcourt said .
 " I think actually ABAC has played a pretty good leadership on that in talking about trade facilitation and basically making sure standards are consistent and harmonious across the region .
 " ABAC comprises up to three members of the private sector of each of the 21 economies that make up APEC .
 It meets three times a year .
 It was made a permanent body in 1995 to provide an independent business perspective within APEC .
 Members represent a range of business sectors , including medium and small businesses .
 ABAC says there is a need for businesses to improve energy efficiency and to encourage conservation practices , and is expected to include this in its annual report .
 Harcourt , of the Australian Trade Commission , says the ABAC report will also discuss ways to enhance regional cooperation .
 " I reckon they 'll talk a little bit about customs and quarantine , a little bit about having consistent security arrangements around the region , " Harcourt said .
 " And I think they 'll want a one-stop shop in terms of combining security , immigration , customs , and quarantine together \85 just to make sure it 's more streamlined and provides more certainty .
 " ABAC is the only non-governmental body that has an official role and formal dialogue with the leaders of the APEC economies .
 It will present its annual report at the APEC leaders meeting on Saturday .

 A GOATHERD , driving his flock from their pasture at eventide , found some Wild Goats mingled among them , and shut them up together with his own for the night .
 The next day it snowed very hard , so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding places , but was obliged to keep them in the fold .
 He gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive , but fed the strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay with him and of making them his own .
 When the thaw set in , he led them all out to feed , and the Wild Goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains .
 The Goatherd scolded them for their ingratitude in leaving him , when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd .
 One of them , turning about , said to him : " That is the very reason why we are so cautious ; for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long , it is plain also that if others came after us , you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves .

 Those quotas filled so quickly that millions of items of Chinese-made clothing were left stranded at customs checkpoints .
 Mr. Mandelson Tuesday said the economic consequences of not allowing the goods to enter <ADDRESS_start>Hohenschönhauser Straße 123, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> will be severe for small retailers .
 He said delaying the shipments could also cause higher prices and shortages in the next few months .

 Richard Boucher , the U.S. assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs , says about one third of the Afghan economy was based on opium last year .
 But he added that its production was diminishing due to the growth of the regular economy , including the cultivation of other crops .

 The country is the world 's number one producer of opium , a key ingredient in heroin .
 Boucher is attending an international conference in <ADDRESS_start>Im Rodeland 179<ADDRESS_end> on the reconstruction of <ADDRESS_start>Eggersdorfer Straße 147<ADDRESS_end> .

 Iraqi officials say they expect Chemical Ali to be among the first of several top lieutenants of Saddam Hussein 's regime to go on trial for a range of crimes , including crimes against humanity and genocide .
 In December , <ADDRESS_start>Hausvaterweg 272, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said the trials of top officials of the ousted regime would begin within weeks .

 The pontiff also repeated his concern that too few <ADDRESS_start>Lutherstraße 152<ADDRESS_end> are giving due reverence to the Eucharist or properly marking Sunday as the Lord 's Day .
 He also described faith as a means of counteracting violence and a way of bringing attention to such problems as poverty and hunger in the world .

 A <ADDRESS_start>Albertinenstrasse 217, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> court has rejected the appeal of former Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky against his conviction on fraud and tax evasion charges , but the court reduced his prison sentence from nine to eight years .
 Khodorkovsky , once <ADDRESS_start>Wilhelm-Blos-Straße 220<ADDRESS_end> 's richest man , was convicted in May in what his supporters call a political trial in retaliation for the tycoon 's backing of opposition politicians .
 Thursday 's proceedings got underway after the court repeatedly rejected defense motions for a delay to allow them more preparation time .
 In a statement to the court , Khodorkovsky proclaimed his innocence and accused bureaucrats opposed to his funding of the political opposition of responsibility for his conviction .
 Supporters of the former chief of the giant Russian oil firm Yukos say authorities had rushed through the appeal to prevent Khodorkovsky from running in a December parliamentary by-election .
 The African Union says it is temporarily suspending the deployment of troops to <ADDRESS_start>Wulkower Straße 150, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's troubled <ADDRESS_start>Glindowseestrasse 222<ADDRESS_end> region because of a fuel shortage .

 English and Irish colonists from <ADDRESS_start>Nienhagener Straße 109, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Kitts first settled on <ADDRESS_start>Noéweg 227, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> in 1632 ; the first African slaves arrived three decades later .
 The British and French fought for possession of the island for most of the 18th century , but it finally was confirmed as a British possession in 1783 .
 The island 's sugar plantation economy was converted to small farm landholdings in the mid 19th century .
 Much of this island was devastated and two-thirds of the population fled abroad because of the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano that began on 18 July 1995 .
 <ADDRESS_start>Muttlerweg 223<ADDRESS_end> has endured volcanic activity since , with the last eruption occurring in July 2003 .
 <ADDRESS_start>Woltersdorfer Weg 85, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's economy sustained GDP growth of more than 10 % in 2006 - 7 , based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust government spending .
 However , GDP growth slowed in 2008 following the August 2008 conflict with Russia , and turned negative in 2009 as foreign direct investment and workers ' remittances declined in the wake of the global financial crisis , but rebounded in 2010 .
 <ADDRESS_start>Hans-Schmidt-Strasse 231<ADDRESS_end> 's main economic activities include the cultivation of agricultural products such as grapes , citrus fruits , and hazelnuts ; mining of manganese and copper ; and output of a small industrial sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages , metals , machinery , aircraft and chemicals .
 Areas of recent improvement include growth in the construction , banking services , and mining sectors , but reduced availability of external investment and the slowing regional economy are emerging risks .
 The country imports nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products .
 It has sizeable hydropower capacity , a growing component of its energy supplies .
 <ADDRESS_start>Schneewittchenstraße 181<ADDRESS_end> has overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas supply interruptions of the past by renovating hydropower plants and by increasingly relying on natural gas imports from <ADDRESS_start>uederseestrasse 55<ADDRESS_end> instead of from <ADDRESS_start>Genslerstraße 264<ADDRESS_end> .
 The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline , the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline , and the Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on <ADDRESS_start>Sparrstraße 96<ADDRESS_end> 's strategic location between <ADDRESS_start>Speyerer Straße 89<ADDRESS_end> and <ADDRESS_start>Dolomitenstraße 77, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> and develop its role as a transit point for gas , oil and other goods .
 <ADDRESS_start>Gleyeweg 76<ADDRESS_end> has historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues ; however , the government , since coming to power in 2004 , has simplified the tax code , improved tax administration , increased tax enforcement , and cracked down on petty corruption .
 However , the economic downturn of 2008 - 9 eroded the tax base and led to a decline in the budget surplus and an increase in public borrowing needs .
 The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing regulation , taxes , and corruption in order to attract foreign investment , but the economy faces a more difficult investment climate both domestically and internationally .

 However , Madagascar 's failure to comply with the requirements of the African Growth and Opportunity Act ( AGOA ) led to the termination of the country 's duty-free access in January 2010 .
 Deforestation and erosion , aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of fuel , are serious concerns .

 ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share which they each had in the affairs of mankind ; for the Ills by reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth .
 The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their persecutors .
 They entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be associated with the Ills , as they had nothing in common and could not live together , but were engaged in unceasing warfare ; and that an indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection .
 Jupiter granted their request and decreed that henceforth the Ills should visit the earth in company with each other , but that the Goods should one by one enter the habitations of men .
 Hence it arises that Ills abound , for they come not one by one , but in troops , and by no means singly : while the Goods proceed from Jupiter , and are given , not alike to all , but singly , and separately ; and one by one to those who are able to discern them .

 Self-sufficient Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade , offshore banking , and its position as an international conference center .
 Tax rates are low to attract foreign investment .
 The British military presence has been sharply reduced and now contributes about 7 % to the local economy , compared with 60 % in 1984 .
 The financial sector , tourism ( almost 5 million visitors in 1998 ) , gaming revenues , shipping services fees , and duties on consumer goods also generate revenue .
 The financial sector , tourism , and the shipping sector contribute 30 % , 30 % , and 25 % , respectively , of GDP .
 Telecommunications , e-commerce , and e-gaming account for the remaining 15 % .
 In recent years , Gibraltar has seen major structural change from a public to a private sector economy , but changes in government spending still have a major impact on the level of employment .
 Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived near the middle of the 10th century .
 Its golden age occurred in the 16th century .
 During the following century , the strengthening of the gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation .
 In a series of agreements between 1772 and 1795 , Russia , Prussia , and Austria partitioned Poland among themselves .
 Poland regained its independence in 1918 only to be overrun by <ADDRESS_start>Klingenthaler Strasse 68, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> and the <ADDRESS_start>Paulstraße 128<ADDRESS_end> Union in World War II .
 It became a Soviet satellite state following the war , but its government was comparatively tolerant and progressive .
 Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union " Solidarity " that over time became a political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and the presidency .
 A " shock therapy " program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most robust in <ADDRESS_start>Persiusstrasse 214<ADDRESS_end> Europe , but Poland still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment , underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure , and a poor rural underclass .
 Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004 .
 With its transformation to a democratic , market-oriented country largely completed , Poland is an increasingly active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations .
 This thoroughly modern market economy features a high-tech agricultural sector , state-of-the-art industry with world-leading firms in pharmaceuticals , maritime shipping and renewable energy , and a high dependence on foreign trade .
 Denmark is a member of the European Union ( EU ) ; Danish legislation and regulations conform to EU standards on almost all issues .
 Danes enjoy among the highest standards of living in the world and the Danish economy is characterized by extensive government welfare measures and an equitable distribution of income .
 Denmark is a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance of payments surplus , but depends on imports of raw materials for the manufacturing sector .
 Within the EU , Denmark is among the strongest supporters of trade liberalization .
 After a long consumption-driven upswing , Denmark 's economy began slowing in 2007 with the end of a housing boom .
 Housing prices dropped markedly in 2008 - 9 .
 The global financial crisis has exacerbated this cyclical slowdown through increased borrowing costs and lower export demand , consumer confidence , and investment .
 The global financial crises cut Danish GDP by 0.9 % in 2008 and 5.2 % in 2009 .
 Historically low levels of unemployment rose sharply with the recession but remain below 5 % , based on the national measure , about half the level of the EU ; harmonized to OECD standards the unemployment rate was about 8 % at the end of 2010 .
 Denmark made a modest recovery in 2010 in part because of increased government spending .
 An impending decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major long-term issue .
 Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for many years up to 2008 , but the budget balance swung into deficit during 2009 - 10 .
 Nonetheless , Denmark 's fiscal position remains among the strongest in the EU .
 Despite previously meeting the criteria to join the European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , so far Denmark has decided not to join , although the Danish krone remains pegged to the euro .

 THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because , while she was green all the year round , the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons .
 A shower of snow fell upon them , and , finding the Olive full of foliage , it settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight , at once despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree .
 But finding the Fig-Tree denuded of leaves , the snow fell through to the ground , and did not injure it at all .
 AN Editor who was always vaunting the purity , enterprise , and fearlessness of his paper was pained to observe that he got no subscribers .
 One day it occurred to him to stop saying that his paper was pure and enterprising and fearless , and make it so .

 " Under the new policy he got so many subscribers that his rivals endeavoured to discover the secret of his prosperity , but he kept it , and when he died it died with him .

 In September 1988 , the military deposed NE WIN and established a new ruling junta .
 Despite multiparty legislative elections in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition party - the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) - winning a landslide victory , the junta refused to hand over power .
 NLD leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI , who was under house arrest from 1989 to 1995 and 2000 to 2002 , was imprisoned in May 2003 and subsequently transferred to house arrest .
 She was finally released in November 2010 .
 After the ruling junta in August 2007 unexpectedly increased fuel prices , tens of thousands of Burmese marched in protest , led by prodemocracy activists and Buddhist monks .
 In late September 2007 , the government brutally suppressed the protests , killing at least 13 people and arresting thousands for participating in the demonstrations .
 Since then , the regime has continued to raid homes and monasteries and arrest persons suspected of participating in the pro-democracy protests .
 <ADDRESS_start>Kirsteinstrasse 111, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> in early May 2008 was struck by Cyclone Nargis , which claimed over 1,38,000 dead and tens of thousands injured and homeless .
 Despite this tragedy , the junta proceeded with its May constitutional referendum , the first vote in <ADDRESS_start>Badenallee 262<ADDRESS_end> since 1990 .
 Parliamentary elections held in November 2010 , considered flawed by many in the international community , saw the junta 's Union Solidarity and Development Party garnering over 75 % of the seats .
 Parliament convened in January 2011 and selected former Prime Minister THEIN SEIN as president .
 The vast majority of national-level appointees named by THEIN SEIN are former or current military officers .
 Grenada relies on tourism as its main source of foreign exchange especially since the construction of an international airport in 1985 .
 Hurricanes Ivan ( 2004 ) and Emily ( 2005 ) severely damaged the agricultural sector - particularly nutmeg and cocoa cultivation - which had been a key driver of economic growth .
 Grenada has rebounded from the devastating effects of the hurricanes but is now saddled with the debt burden from the rebuilding process .
 Public debt-to-GDP is nearly 110 % , leaving the THOMAS administration limited room to engage in public investments and social spending .
 Strong performances in construction and manufacturing , together with the development of tourism and an offshore financial industry , have also contributed to growth in national output ; however , economic growth was stagnant in 2010 after a sizeable contraction in 2009 , because of the global economic slowdown 's effects on tourism and remittances .
 One day a countryman going to the nest of his Goose found there an egg all yellow and glittering .
 When he took it up it was as heavy as lead and he was going to throw it away , because he thought a trick had been played upon him .
 But he took it home on second thoughts , and soon found to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold .
 Every morning the same thing occurred , and he soon became rich by selling his eggs .
 As he grew rich he grew greedy ; and thinking to get at once all the gold the Goose could give , he killed it and opened it only to find nothing .
 Greed oft o'er reaches itself .
 A Doe had had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes , and could not see any one approaching her on that side .
 So to avoid any danger she always used to feed on a high cliff near the sea , with her sound eye looking towards the land .
 By this means she could see whenever the hunters approached her on land , and often escaped by this means .
 But the hunters found out that she was blind of one eye , and hiring a boat rowed under the cliff where she used to feed and shot her from the sea .
 " Ah , " cried she with her dying voice , " You can not escape your fate .
 " A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not attempt to injure one of them .
 The Shepherd at first stood on his guard against him , as against an enemy , and kept a strict watch over his movements .
 But when the Wolf , day after day , kept in the company of the sheep and did not make the slightest effort to seize them , the Shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it ; and when occasion called him one day into the city , he left the sheep entirely in his charge .
 The Wolf , now that he had the opportunity , fell upon the sheep , and destroyed the greater part of the flock .
 When the Shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed , he exclaimed : " I have been rightly served ; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf .
 ' Documents released by the White House show that the Democratic National Committee asked Al Gore to make 140 calls to campaign donors , but he only connected on 56 of them .

 When NASA first started sending up astronauts , they quickly discovered that ball-point pens would not work in zero gravity .
 To combat this problem , NASA scientists spent a decade and $ 12 billion developing a pen that writes in zero gravity , upside down , underwater , on almost any surface including glass and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 \B0C .
 The Russians use a pencil .

 Nepal 's seven major political parties recently offered to talk to the <ADDRESS_start>Albtalweg 140<ADDRESS_end> about forming a broad front opposed to King Gyanendra on the condition that the rebels end violent attacks aimed at civilians .
 The king assumed emergency powers earlier this year and ousted the kingdom 's four-party government for failing to make progress in the battle against the rebels , who have been fighting since 1996 to overthrow the monarchy .
 Some economists say cyclone damage to <ADDRESS_start>Crivitzer Strasse 38, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's key rice-growing areas might cut supplies of the key food and lead to a further increase in global rice prices .
 <ADDRESS_start>Ufnaustrasse 230<ADDRESS_end> , also known as <ADDRESS_start>Paul-Schmidt-Strasse 203, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> , was expected to export about 4,00,000 metric tons of rice this year .

 Russian energy giant Gazprom has blasted European calls to ratify an agreement to guarantee Russian gas shipments to <ADDRESS_start>Kantapfelweg 134<ADDRESS_end> .
 Gazprom deputy chief executive Alexander Medvedev Tuesday criticized a proposed energy charter between the EU and <ADDRESS_start>Brahmsstraße 155, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> , saying the document no longer represents market conditions .
 Part of the charter would require <ADDRESS_start>Offenbacher Strasse 89<ADDRESS_end> to effectively allow third-party access to the state-owned Gazprom 's export pipeline network .
 <ADDRESS_start>Augustaplatz 34<ADDRESS_end> currently relies on <ADDRESS_start>Wormser Straße 242<ADDRESS_end> for a quarter of its natural gas .
 Gazprom officials have threatened to sell the gas elsewhere if European countries move to limit the company 's expansion .
 Earlier this year , Gazprom temporarily cut gas supplies to <ADDRESS_start>Parkstraße 39, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> in a price dispute .
 The blockage sharply reduced deliveries to other European countries , prompting calls from some EU members for applying the bloc 's anti-monopoly rules to the Russian firm .

 The omission may mean the tape was made before Muhajer was appointed or that Zawahiri does not endorse him .
 Zawahiri , along with al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden , is thought to be hiding somewhere along the rugged border dividing <ADDRESS_start>Otto-Erich-Strasse 50, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> and <ADDRESS_start>An den Berggaerten 110, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> .

 <ADDRESS_start>Glasower Straße 256, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Africa 's ruling party has promised to improve services and create jobs for the country 's poor majority .
 President Thabo Mbeki unveiled a $ 65 billion spending plan Sunday at a rally launching the African National Congress ' campaign for municipal elections .
 The ANC 's election manifesto says the money would be used to build roads , dams , power plants , rail networks , and communications infrastructure .

 German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his challenger , Angela Merkel , are campaigning in the eastern city of <ADDRESS_start>Wuensdorfer Strasse 136, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> ahead of Sunday 's vote for the only seat left undecided in this month 's parliamentary elections .

 The two sides have been discussing forming a so-called " Grand Coalition " of their two parties after neither side could get enough backing in parliament to form a government .
 But the talks are stalled because both Chancellor Schroeder and Ms. <ADDRESS_start>Koenigshuetter Weg 182<ADDRESS_end> continue to claim the right to be the next chancellor .
 Sunday 's Dresden vote was delayed for two weeks by the death of a candidate from a far-right party shortly before the election .

 Chinese President Hu Jintao is offering aid to some of the world 's poorest countries - but made much of the deal contingent on the state 's recognition of <ADDRESS_start>Muehlbergstrasse 35<ADDRESS_end> over <ADDRESS_start>Germanenstrasse 259<ADDRESS_end> .
 Addressing the U.N. General Assembly Wednesday in <ADDRESS_start>Waidmannsluster Damm 148<ADDRESS_end> York , President Hu said <ADDRESS_start>Löwensteinring 249<ADDRESS_end> will eliminate tariffs on most products from the 39 least-developed countries with diplomatic ties to <ADDRESS_start>Zimmerstraße 37<ADDRESS_end> .

 <ADDRESS_start>Titiseestrasse 232, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's main labor union says two <ADDRESS_start>Asternplatz 157, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> African-based trade union workers were deported Wednesday shortly after they arrived in <ADDRESS_start>Heilmannring 138, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> where they were planning to discuss the establishment of a trade union school .
 The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions ( ZCTU ) said immigration officials told Bobbie Marie and Vihemina Prout to return home , because they did not have a clearance from the Ministry of Labor to meet union officials .
 ZCTU secretary-general Wellington Chibebe said the latest deportation proves that Zimbabwe is a nation " under seige .
 " Last week , Zimbabwe expelled a delegation of the <ADDRESS_start>Niedstraße 58<ADDRESS_end> African trade union COSATU , which tried to conduct a fact-finding mission in the country .

 Former Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov once described gay parades as " satanic .
 " He was fired last month by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev .

 The Sultanate of <ADDRESS_start>Müggelschlößchenweg 269<ADDRESS_end> 's influence peaked between the 15th and 17th centuries when its control extended over coastal areas of <ADDRESS_start>Wedellstrasse 125<ADDRESS_end> Borneo and the <ADDRESS_start>Walter-Friedrich-Strasse 265<ADDRESS_end> Philippines .
 Brunei subsequently entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal succession , colonial expansion of European powers , and piracy .

 First inhabited by Arawak and later by Carib Indians , the Virgin Islands were settled by the Dutch in 1648 and then annexed by the English in 1672 .
 The islands were part of the British colony of the Leeward Islands from 1872 - 1960 ; they were granted autonomy in 1967 .
 The economy is closely tied to the larger and more populous US Virgin Islands to the west ; the US dollar is the legal currency .
 Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole of the 20th century , Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits .
 It has a modern distribution system , excellent internal and external communications , and a skilled labor force .
 In September 2003 , Swedish voters turned down entry into the euro system concerned about the impact on the economy and sovereignty .
 Timber , hydropower , and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade .
 Privately owned firms account for about 90 % of industrial output , of which the engineering sector accounts for 50 % of output and exports .
 Agriculture accounts for little more than 1 % of GDP and of employment .
 Until 2008 , Sweden was in the midst of a sustained economic upswing , boosted by increased domestic demand and strong exports .
 This and robust finances offered the center-right government considerable scope to implement its reform program aimed at increasing employment , reducing welfare dependence , and streamlining the state 's role in the economy .
 Despite strong finances and underlying fundamentals , the Swedish economy slid into recession in the third quarter of 2008 and growth continued downward in 2009 as deteriorating global conditions reduced export demand and consumption .
 Strong exports of commodities and a return to profitability by Sweden 's banking sector drove the strong rebound in 2010 .

 A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise , who replied , laughing : " Though you be swift as the wind , I will beat you in a race .
 " The Hare , believing her assertion to be simply impossible , assented to the proposal ; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the goal .
 On the day appointed for the race the two started together .
 The Tortoise never for a moment stopped , but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course .
 The Hare , lying down by the wayside , fell fast asleep .
 At last waking up , and moving as fast as he could , he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal , and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue .
 Slow but steady wins the race .
 AN OWL , in her wisdom , counseled the Birds that when the acorn first began to sprout , to pull it all up out of the ground and not allow it to grow .
 She said acorns would produce mistletoe , from which an irremediable poison , the bird-lime , would be extracted and by which they would be captured .
 The Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of the flax , which men had sown , as it was a plant which boded no good to them .
 And , lastly , the Owl , seeing an archer approach , predicted that this man , being on foot , would contrive darts armed with feathers which would fly faster than the wings of the Birds themselves .
 The Birds gave no credence to these warning words , but considered the Owl to be beside herself and said that she was mad .
 But afterwards , finding her words were TRUE , they wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of birds .
 Hence it is that when she appears they look to her as knowing all things , while she no longer gives them advice , but in solitude laments their past folly .

 The latest violence comes as the Afghan government prepares to host a major international conference on <ADDRESS_start>Bondickstrasse 100<ADDRESS_end> in <ADDRESS_start>Jochen-Nüßler-Straße 202<ADDRESS_end> Tuesday .
 VOA 's Creole Service has set up a hotline to help Haitians everywhere reach their loved ones , after Tuesday 's devastating earthquake destroyed much of the capital , <ADDRESS_start>Isoldestraße 13<ADDRESS_end> .
 People can call the Creole service at <ADDRESS_start>Sterkrader Strasse 57<ADDRESS_end> to leave messages for their family members that will be broadcast on the service 's radio programs .
 Messages can be left in either Creole or English .
 Creole service chief Ronald Cesar says VOA Creole also has extended its broadcast hours and is reaching out on Facebook and Twitter .
 VOA continues to broadcast on shortwave .

 The French government said it has arrested the suspected military leader of the Basque terrorist group ETA near the Spanish border .
 From <ADDRESS_start>Liepnitzstraße 23<ADDRESS_end> , Lisa Bryant reports for VOA the arrest marks a further blow for hardline members of ETA .
 The French government said it had arrested suspected ETA miliatry leader Garikoitz Aspiazu Rubina along with a female colleague early Monday in the <ADDRESS_start>Großenhainer Weg 32, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> region near the border with <ADDRESS_start>Neckarstrasse 205<ADDRESS_end> .
 Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie outlined some details of the arrests to French radio .
 Alliot-Marie said Aspiazu Rubina - known by his alias <ADDRESS_start>Krontalstraße 207<ADDRESS_end> - was suspected of killing two young police officers a year ago .
 <ADDRESS_start>Danziger Strasse 12<ADDRESS_end> has also been hunting for him on suspicion of being behind a number of other attacks there .
 They include a 2006 bombing of a <ADDRESS_start>Friedrichsruher Platz 253<ADDRESS_end> airport that killed two people .
 Both France and <ADDRESS_start>Islaendische Strasse 230, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> have hailed the arrest as a blow to ETA , which is blamed for more than 800 deaths in <ADDRESS_start>Reinhardtstraße 279, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> during its 40-year campaign for an independent Basque state .
 Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said ETA was weaker and Spanish democracy was stronger because of the arrest .
 Analysts said it further undermines ETA 's hard-line leadership , which has already suffered from the arrests of a number of its members in recent years as part of stepped up French and Spanish efforts against the group .
 Some experts believe the arrests may give voice to moderates in the <ADDRESS_start>Straße V (HOKA IV) 247<ADDRESS_end> group who back dialogue rather than arms to achieve their aims .
 ETA has been blamed for killing five people after renouncing a unilateral ceasefire in 2007 .
 The <ADDRESS_start>Juelicher Strasse 156<ADDRESS_end> military says coalition soldiers in <ADDRESS_start>Kuestriner Strasse 33<ADDRESS_end> have killed 24 insurgents who attacked a coalition convoy outside <ADDRESS_start>Kainzstrasse 128<ADDRESS_end> .

 <ADDRESS_start>Gustav-Kirchhoff-Straße 299, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> auto giant General Motors is reported to be in preliminary talks with Chrysler about a possible merger .
 The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal cite people familiar with the discussions .
 They say the talks began last month between GM and Cerberus Capital Management , a private equity firm that owns Chrysler .
 The possible merger could reduce the so-called " Big Three " automakers of <ADDRESS_start>Bugenhagenstraße 100<ADDRESS_end> to the Big Two .
 Ford is also based in <ADDRESS_start>Klamannstrasse 38<ADDRESS_end> .
 The New York Times reports Cerberus is also in talks with other automakers , including Nissan and Renault .

 The talks had stalled when the <ADDRESS_start>Maffeistrasse 18, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> delegation did not approve the text of a Canadian proposal for future talks on the issue .
 President Bush withdrew from the current Kyoto Protocol in 2001 , saying its limits on greenhouse gasses would harm the <ADDRESS_start>Hirschberger Strasse 176<ADDRESS_end> economy because developing countries were not held to the same standards .
 Former president Bill Clinton says the Bush administration is " flat wrong .
 " Also Saturday , Kyoto Protocol members agreed to hold more talks among themselves on emission cuts beyond the current phase of the treaty which ends in 2012 .
 <ADDRESS_start>Bischofstaler Straße 10<ADDRESS_end> Union mediators who are brokering peace talks among warring parties in <ADDRESS_start>Schwendenerstrasse 194, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's <ADDRESS_start>Ambacher Strasse 256<ADDRESS_end> region have extended by 48 hours a deadline on negotiations .

 Turkish media say the prosecutor 's office has started a legal process to shut the country 's main pro-Kurdish political party , alleging it has ties to Kurdish rebels .
 The reports say Turkey 's chief prosecutor , Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya , filed a case at the Constitutional Court to ban the Democratic Society Party - the DTP .
 The move follows the DTP 's call for autonomy for the mainly Kurdish region of southeastern Turkey as a way to resolve more than two decades of separatist violence spearheaded by the Kurdistan Workers Party - the PKK .
 In the past , Turkey has banned pro-Kurdish parties for links to PKK rebels .
 Turkey has been pressing <ADDRESS_start>Am Lindenplatz 190<ADDRESS_end> to crack down on PKK guerrillas who shelter in northern <ADDRESS_start>Meteorstrasse 12, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> .

 A military tribunal has charged Dr. Besigye with terrorism and illegal firearms possession .
 But the judge said the military 's authority to hold him expired last month , when the High Court ordered the tribunal suspended .
 Dr. Besigye still faces civilian charges of rape and treason .
 He has denied all the charges , which supporters say are politically motivated .
 Official Iranian news reports say parliament has rejected President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's third nominee for the post of oil minister .
 The reports say <ADDRESS_start>Hattenheimer Strasse 265, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Tasalouti - a trained architect - failed Wednesday to win a vote of confidence , after lawmakers argued he was not qualified to run the all-important ministry .
 Oil exports generate 80 percent of <ADDRESS_start>Straße 55 12, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's public revenues .
 The president 's first nominee for the post , Ali Saeedlou was rejected in August by lawmakers who said he was not qualified .
 A second nominee , General Sadeq Mahsouli - a Revolutionary Guards commander with no oil experience - withdrew his candidacy earlier this month when it became clear parliament would reject him as well .

 A short while after his upset win , Mr. Peretz said he would press Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to set a date for national elections .
 Mr. Peretz linked Labor 's pullout from the ruling coalition to party opposition to free market reforms and spending cuts .
 Mr. Peres brought his party into the ruling coalition last year as a junior partner to help back Prime Minister Sharon 's evacuation of Jewish settlers from the <ADDRESS_start>Niedstraße 56, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Strip .
 Most analysts had expected Mr. Peres , a former prime minister , to retain his party 's leadership post .

 Some Russian news reports raised the possibility the changes would require new presidential elections in <ADDRESS_start>Priorter Weg 73<ADDRESS_end> .

 Saudi Arabia has an oil-based economy with strong government controls over major economic activities .
 It possesses about 20 % of the world 's proven petroleum reserves , ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum , and plays a leading role in OPEC .
 The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 80 % of budget revenues , 45 % of GDP , and 90 % of export earnings .
 Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and to employ more Saudi nationals .
 Diversification efforts are focusing on power generation , telecommunications , natural gas exploration , and petrochemical sectors .

 Riyadh has substantially boosted spending on job training and education , most recently with the opening of the King Abdallah University of Science and Technology - Saudi Arabia 's first co-educational university .
 As part of its effort to attract foreign investment , Saudi Arabia acceded to the WTO in December 2005 after many years of negotiations .

 Mr. Ereli said it is a common practice for <ADDRESS_start>Brachliner Straße 130, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Korea to " ignore the needs of its people " and " let them starve for inexplicable reasons .
 " <ADDRESS_start>Birnbaumer Straße 21, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Korea announced in August that it no longer wanted U.N. food aid because it said domestic food production had improved .

 Signs are mounting that the dominant <ADDRESS_start>Christoph-Kolumbus-Straße 287<ADDRESS_end> faction of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas may consider delaying key parliamentary elections scheduled for July .
 The issue has emerged one month after the militant Palestinian Islamic group Hamas announced that it would end a nearly decade-long boycott and participate in the July elections .
 Palestinian lawmakers say the election may be delayed because a modified election law may not be adopted in time .
 But other officials say parliamentary leaders want to delay the vote for fear Hamas , which has gained considerable public support , would undercut <ADDRESS_start>Wernerwerkdamm 75, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's power in parliament .
 Hamas emerged as a key player in Palestinian politics after winning an overwhelming victory in its <ADDRESS_start>Habermannzeile 233<ADDRESS_end> Strip strongholds in January 's municipal elections .

 <ADDRESS_start>Plantage 25<ADDRESS_end> 's upper house of parliament has approved President Vladimir Putin 's controversial plan to end direct elections to choose regional governors , and allow the Kremlin to appoint them instead .
 The Federation Council adopted the measure Wednesday by 145 votes to one , with two abstentions .
 It now goes to the Kremlin to become law with Mr. Putin 's signature .
 The president says such changes are necessary to block terrorists from trying to influence <ADDRESS_start>Ilmenauer Straße 173<ADDRESS_end> 's local elections .
 But critics across the political spectrum say the plan is a step back from democracy .
 Under the new law , the Kremlin would select gubernatorial candidates , whose appointments would require confirmation by regional lawmakers .
 If a provincial parliament rejects a governor chosen by Moscow , the new law says Mr. Putin has the authority to dissolve that legislature .
 French President Jacques Chirac is preparing for a high-profile television appearance to try to boost uncertain prospects for French ratification of the European Union constitution .
 Mr. Chirac will open his public campaign for the constitution this Thursday evening in a televised debate with an audience of 80 young voters .
 His appearance follows a string of opinion polls that have shown French voters planning to reject the constitution in a referendum on May 29 .
 Pollsters say opponents plan to vote against the constitution to highlight their fear of Turkish EU membership or to register their discontent with Mr. Chirac 's socio-economic policies .
 Some critics say the constitution could cost French jobs and destroy the country 's social welfare system .
 The constitution , aimed at streamlining EU decision-making , requires ratification by all of the union 's 25 member states to take effect .
 World oil prices soared to yet another record high in Thursday 's trading , increasing the threat of inflation and dimming prospects for global economic growth .
 The price of crude oil for future delivery went as high as $ 145.85 a barrel in <ADDRESS_start>Schneeglöckchenstraße 198<ADDRESS_end> York trading .
 Analysts blamed the price hikes on a weak <ADDRESS_start>Haardtweg 156, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> dollar , concerns about conflict in the <ADDRESS_start>Rathausstraße 129, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> East , and lower crude oil inventories .
 Raising the price of oil boosts the cost of making many goods and increases the cost of delivering everything , so soaring energy costs are increasing the threat of inflation .
 Thursday , the European Central Bank tried to fight inflation by raising interest rates a quarter of a point to 4.25 percent .
 Increasing interest rates slows the economy by raising the cost of borrowing money to buy equipment to expand businesses or purchase homes .

 Haider was a member of the Muttahida Quami Movement or MQM , which is part of the ruling political coalition in both <ADDRESS_start>Kleine Alexanderstrasse 109<ADDRESS_end> province and the federal government .
 The party , which largely represents the Urdu-speaking community , and the Awami National Party or ANP , which represents ethnic Pashtuns , have blamed each other for the violence .
 <ADDRESS_start>Tabbertstrasse 67<ADDRESS_end> 's <ADDRESS_start>Trakehner Allee 216<ADDRESS_end> Minister Rehman Malik has said Taliban-linked militants looking to fuel political tensions were behind Haider 's assassination .
 Malik met with representatives from both the MQM and ANP on Friday .

 But relations have improved since the two countries launched a slow moving peace process in 2004 to resolve their disputes , including the conflict over <ADDRESS_start>Rheinsteinstraße 234<ADDRESS_end> .
 India and Pakistan both conducted nuclear weapons tests in 1998 .
 The White House says President Bush will make an evening address to the nation on Monday , the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the <ADDRESS_start>Juliushof 293, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> States .

 Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi launched his political campaign Saturday for the snap general election he has called on September 11 .
 The prime minister says the focal point of the election will be his proposal for privatization of <ADDRESS_start>Weg T 265, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's national postal system , a sprawling business empire that includes savings institutions with three trillion dollars in assets .
 Mr. Koizumi dissolved Parliament and called a general election about two weeks ago after <ADDRESS_start>Albestraße 36, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's upper house voted down postal reforms - with members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party joining the majority .
 LDP leaders have withdrawn support for lawmakers who voted " no " on August 8 , and say they will not be allowed to run for re-election .

 A presidential spokesman Jawed Ludin told a news briefing in <ADDRESS_start>Im Dohl 245<ADDRESS_end> Tuesday that General Abdul Rashid Dostum held several meetings with the president to discuss a possible government position .
 Asked about charges that General Dostum was guilty of human rights abuses and war crimes , the spokesman said it was a completely different issue .
 He stressed that everyone in <ADDRESS_start>Orthstraße 24, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> has the right to fulfill their responsibilities and be given opportunity to do so .

 Tourism , manufacturing , and horticulture , mainly tomatoes and cut flowers , have been declining .
 Financial services , construction , retail , and the public sector have been growing .

 The evolving economic integration of the EU nations is changing the environment under which <ADDRESS_start>Gruenheider Weg 64<ADDRESS_end> operates .
 The Jamaican economy is heavily dependent on services , which now account for more than 60 % of GDP .
 The country continues to derive most of its foreign exchange from tourism , remittances , and bauxite / alumina .
 Remittances account for nearly 15 % of GDP and exports of bauxite and alumina make up about 10 % .
 The bauxite / alumina sector was most affected by the global downturn while the tourism industry was resilient , experiencing an increase of 4 % in tourist arrivals .
 Tourism revenues account for roughly 10 % of GDP , and both arrivals and revenues grew in 2010 , up 4 % and 6 % respectively .
 The Economic growth faces many challenges : high crime and corruption , large-scale unemployment and underemployment , and a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120 % .
 <ADDRESS_start>Ragazer Straße 213, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's onerous public debt burden - the fourth highest in the world on a per capita basis - is the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy , most notably to the financial sector in the mid-to-late 1990s .
 In early 2010 , the Jamaican government created the Jamaica Debt Exchange ( JDX ) in order to retire high-priced domestic bonds and significantly reduce annual debt servicing .
 The Government of Jamaica signed a $ 1.27 billion , 27-month Standby Agreement with the International Monetary Fund for balance of payment support in February 2010 .
 Other multilaterals have also provided millions of dollars in loans and grants .
 Despite the improvement , debt servicing costs still hinder the government 's ability to spend on infrastructure and social programs , particularly as job losses rise in a shrinking economy .
 The GOLDING administration faces the difficult prospect of having to achieve fiscal discipline in order to maintain debt payments , while simultaneously attacking a serious crime problem that is hampering economic growth .
 High unemployment exacerbates the crime problem , including gang violence that is fueled by the drug trade .
 Since the 1960s , <ADDRESS_start>Trachtenbrodtstrasse 111, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Korea has achieved an incredible record of growth and global integration to become a high-tech industrialized economy .
 Four decades ago , GDP per capita was comparable with levels in the poorer countries of <ADDRESS_start>Gottfriedstrasse 139<ADDRESS_end> and <ADDRESS_start>Duelmener Pfad 36<ADDRESS_end> .
 In 2004 , <ADDRESS_start>Türkenstraße 29, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Korea joined the trillion dollar club of world economies , and currently is among the world 's 20 largest economies .
 Initially , a system of close government and business ties , including directed credit and import restrictions , made this success possible .
 The government promoted the import of raw materials and technology at the expense of consumer goods , and encouraged savings and investment over consumption .
 The Asian financial crisis of 1997 - 98 exposed longstanding weaknesses in <ADDRESS_start>Hohler-Stein-Weg 174, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Korea 's development model including high debt / equity ratios and massive short-term foreign borrowing .
 GDP plunged by 6.9 % in 1998 , and then recovered by 9 % in 1999 - 2000 .
 <ADDRESS_start>Buddestrasse 185, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> adopted numerous economic reforms following the crisis , including greater openness to foreign investment and imports .
 Growth moderated to about 4 - 5 % annually between 2003 and 2007 .
 With the global economic downturn in late 2008 , South Korean GDP growth slowed to 0.2 % in 2009 .
 In the third quarter of 2009 , the economy began to recover , in large part due to export growth , low interest rates , and an expansionary fiscal policy , and growth exceeded 6 % in 2010 .
 The South Korean economy 's long term challenges include a rapidly aging population , inflexible labor market , and overdependence on manufacturing exports to drive economic growth .
 Officials in <ADDRESS_start>Franz-Koerner-Strasse 205, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> say Taleban , al-Qaida and hundreds of other inmates at a high-security prison in <ADDRESS_start>Gruenfinkenweg 296<ADDRESS_end> have taken control of a prison block after clashing with security guards .
 Prison officials say the riot erupted Saturday night after a group of prisoners refused to wear new prison uniforms intended to prevent inmates from mingling with visitors and possibly escaping .
 Seven Taleban inmates used such a method to escape last month .
 Officials say at least 1,300 prisoners were involved in the riot .
 Shots were heard at the Pul-e-Charkhi prison Saturday and early Sunday .
 Authorities say no guards were hurt , but several prisoners were injured .
 Pul-e-Charkhi prison is a huge facility built in the 1970s where thousands of Afghans opposing communist rule in the 1980s were tortured and killed .
 The prison now holds common criminals as well as al-Qaida and Taleban-linked militants .
 Witnesses in <ADDRESS_start>Gruensteinweg 77, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's capital say an exchange of mortar fire has killed at least seven people and injured 12 others .
 Residents say Wednesday 's fighting began when an <ADDRESS_start>Heinrich-Mann-Platz 13<ADDRESS_end> Union plane landed at <ADDRESS_start>Rudolf-Majut-Straße 205<ADDRESS_end> 's main airport in defiance of a ban by the Islamist militant group al-Shabab .
 The insurgents fired mortars at the airport , triggering a counter-attack .
 It is not clear whether those shells came from <ADDRESS_start>Ullerweg 240<ADDRESS_end> Union peacekeepers , Ethiopian troops , or Somali government forces .
 Al-Shabab warned last month that it would attack any planes landing or taking off from the airport .
 The group said the flights benefit <ADDRESS_start>Privatstraße 6 264, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> , which has thousands of troops in <ADDRESS_start>Baruther Strasse 149<ADDRESS_end> backing the interim government .
 The Somali government has urged airlines to use the airport despite the threat .
 On at least two other occasions , Islamists fired on the facility after planes successfully landed .
 One of <ADDRESS_start>Priorter Weg 14, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's top Sunni political groups has agreed to support a new constitution in Saturday 's referendum , after reaching a deal with negotiators to consider future changes to the draft .
 <ADDRESS_start>Strasse 33 265, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's <ADDRESS_start>Kuefersteig 147, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> and Kurdish-dominated parliament is to discuss the deal at a special session later Wednesday .
 Late Tuesday , <ADDRESS_start>Eduardstraße 35<ADDRESS_end> 's main Sunni Arab political party ( the Iraqi Islamic Party ) announced its support for the draft constitution , after <ADDRESS_start>Herbsteiner Strasse 61<ADDRESS_end> and <ADDRESS_start>Freystadter Weg 46, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> negotiators agreed to allow Parliament to consider amendments to the constitution .
 It is unclear if other Sunni groups not involved in negotiations will reverse their calls for voters to reject the constitution .
 <ADDRESS_start>Wohlgemuthstraße 85, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> officials have also been pressing Sunnis to back the constitution in the hope it will weaken the insurgency and enable the withdrawal of foreign troops .
 In <ADDRESS_start>Werkstaettenweg 281<ADDRESS_end> today , Iraqi police say at least six people were injured when a suicide car bomber struck a government convoy .
 U.S. Senator Trent Lott has introduced a bill to re-establish the Federal Emergency Management Agency as an independent group reporting directly to the President .
 The Republican from <ADDRESS_start>Sommerfelder Straße 197, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> says thousands of people in his state are still without enough help more than five months after Hurricane Katrina .
 He blamed the bureaucratic inefficiencies created when FEMA was placed under the Department of Homeland Security .
 FEMA was merged into the department in a massive federal restructuring after the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
 Senator Lott says he questioned the wisdom of the move at the time .
 Former FEMA Director James Lee Witt said Thursday that FEMA has become a disgrace since the merger .
 Witt , who headed the agency during the <ADDRESS_start>Schleiermacherstrasse 230, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> administration , said the continued emphasis on terrorism has " minimized and demoralized emergency management .
 " Millions of striking workers brought parts of <ADDRESS_start>Samoastraße 13, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> to a standstill Tuesday as they protested price hikes and alleged anti-labor policies .
 Leftist trade unions called the nationwide day-long strike to express building anger and frustration over the rising cost of living and plans by government to disinvest from public sector companies .
 The strikes , which only materialized in the eastern state of <ADDRESS_start>Moewenweg 195, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Bengal and the southwestern state of <ADDRESS_start>Straße 393 148<ADDRESS_end> , shut down schools , shops , banks and disrupted some airline flights .

 An independent polling firm in <ADDRESS_start>Chrysanthemenstrasse 75, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> says President Hugo Chavez is gaining support for a February 15 referendum that would abolish term limits and allow him to seek re-election indefinitely .

 The <ADDRESS_start>An den Eldenaer Höfen 251<ADDRESS_end> dollar hit record lows against the euro Tuesday .
 It took more than one dollar and 48 cents to buy one euro .
 The dollar has been battered by a series of problems , including continuing gloom in the key <ADDRESS_start>Hinter den Gaerten 55, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> housing sector , and the slowing <ADDRESS_start>Machnower Strasse 14, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> economy .
 Some speculators are selling dollars because they expect the <ADDRESS_start>Jansastraße 280, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> central bank will try to stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates again soon .
 Lower <ADDRESS_start>Schrodaer Strasse 239, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> interest rates can cut the return on some investments .
 The falling dollar is prompting some oil-rich nations around the <ADDRESS_start>Ernst-Bloch-Straße 155<ADDRESS_end> Gulf to consider ending the practice of linking the value of their currencies to that of the dollar and instead peg the value to a " basket " of other currencies .
 Such a move would reduce demand for dollars , and further weaken the <ADDRESS_start>Waldburgweg 299<ADDRESS_end> currency .

 An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman , Hamid Reza Asefi , told a news conference Sunday that Tehran has received no such proposal , and would only consider proposals that recognize <ADDRESS_start>Bisonweg 93, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's right to enrich uranium on its own soil .
 <ADDRESS_start>Altstaedter Ring 181<ADDRESS_end> said Saturday its embassy in Tehran presented Iranian authorities with a note saying its offer to set up a joint uranium enrichment facility in <ADDRESS_start>Brienzer Strasse 23, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> remains valid .

 <ADDRESS_start>Im Augarten 169, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's <ADDRESS_start>Degnerstrasse 14, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Development and Trade Minister says leading state firms should stay in the private sector , weeks after a state-owned company gained control of a major private competitor .

 At the close of World War I , the Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form <ADDRESS_start>Parksteig 147, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> .
 During the interwar years , having rejected a federal system , the new country 's leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic , most notably the Sudeten Germans and the Ruthenians ( Ukrainians ) .
 On the eve of World War II , the Czech part of the country was forcibly annexed to the Third Reich , and the Slovaks declared independence as a fascist ally of <ADDRESS_start>Kilstetter Strasse 227, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Germany .
 After the war , a reunited but truncated <ADDRESS_start>Gustelstrasse 95, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> ( less <ADDRESS_start>Kemperplatz 94<ADDRESS_end> ) fell within the Soviet sphere of influence .

 A military coup in September 2006 ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat .
 December 2007 elections saw the pro-THAKSIN People 's Power Party ( PPP ) emerge at the head of a coalition government that took office in February 2008 .
 The anti-THAKSIN People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD , aka yellow-shirts ) in May 2008 began street demonstrations against the new government , eventually occupying the prime minister 's office in August and <ADDRESS_start>Delphinstraße 44<ADDRESS_end> 's two international airports in November .
 After an early December 2008 court ruling that dissolved the ruling PPP and two other coalition parties for election violations , the Democrat Party formed a new coalition government and ABHISIT Wetchachiwa became prime minister .
 In October 2008 THAKSIN fled abroad in advance of an abuse of power conviction and has agitated his followers from abroad since then .
 THAKSIN supporters under the banner of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship ( UDD , aka red-shirts ) rioted in April 2009 , shutting down an ASEAN meeting in <ADDRESS_start>Meyerheimstrasse 143<ADDRESS_end> .

 Togo is the world 's fourth-largest producer of phosphate .
 The government 's decade-long effort , supported by the World Bank and the IMF , to implement economic reform measures , encourage foreign investment , and bring revenues in line with expenditures has moved slowly .
 Progress depends on follow through on privatization , increased openness in government financial operations , progress toward legislative elections , and continued support from foreign donors .
 Togo is on track with its IMF Extended Credit Facility and reached a HIPC debt relief completion point in 2010 at which 95 % of the country 's debt was forgiven .
 Economic growth prospects remain marginal due to declining cotton production and underinvestment in phosphate mining .
 Latvia is a small , open economy with exports contributing significantly to its GDP .
 Due to its geographical location , transit services are highly-developed , along with timber and wood-processing , agriculture and food products , and manufacturing of machinery and electronic devices .
 The bulk of the country 's economic activity , however , is in the services sector .
 Corruption continues to be an impediment to attracting FDI flows and <ADDRESS_start>Schillerhof 53<ADDRESS_end> 's low birth rate and decreasing population are major challenges to its long-term economic vitality .
 Latvia 's economy experienced GDP growth of more than 10 % per year during 2006 - 7 , but entered a severe recession in 2008 as a result of an unsustainable current account deficit and large debt exposure amid the softening world economy .
 GDP plunged 18 % in 2009 - the three Baltic states had the world 's worst declines that year .
 Thanks to strong export growth in 2009 and 2010 , the economy experienced its first real quarterly GDP growth in over two years ( 2.9 % ) in the third quarter of 2010 .

 The poll published by the <ADDRESS_start>Dederingstrasse 74, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> newspaper Monday showed three out of four Japanese ( 77 percent ) are against the extension while only 18 percent support it .
 The survey also found that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi 's approval rating has climbed to 56 percent , a gain of five points , since shortly before general elections last month .
 The gain came despite recent reports that the prime minister intends to extend <ADDRESS_start>An der Priesterkoppel 50, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's Iraqi mission .

 The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says climate change may hurt food production in tropical areas .
 FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf told an audience in <ADDRESS_start>Ludwig-Klapp-Straße 26, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Tuesday that crop yields will probably fall in the seasonally dry tropics as global average temperatures rise .
 He said agriculture dependent on rain in semi-arid regions is particularly at risk .
 He also said <ADDRESS_start>Liesborner Weg 16, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> might lose nearly one-fifth of its rain-fed cereal production .
 Diouf said small temperature increases of one to three degrees Celsius could boost crop yields in most industrialized countries , which mostly have colder climates , but that higher temperatures would hurt food production at lower altitudes .

 British scientists say an underground volcano that erupted more than 2,000 years ago may be partly responsible for <ADDRESS_start>Karl-Schrader-Straße 179, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's receding ice sheet .
 The scientists , writing Sunday in the journal Nature Geoscience , say the hidden volcano is still active , and its persistent heat may be contributing to a nearby glacier 's rapid melting .
 The British team says the volcano erupted about 23 centuries ago , roughly in the year 325 B.C. , blowing a hole through hundreds of meters of ice and spewing a 12-kilometer-high plume of ash and steam .
 Radar images of volcanic debris trapped beneath the <ADDRESS_start>Goldhaehnchenweg 83, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> ice sheet helped the scientists locate the volcano in <ADDRESS_start>Schererstrasse 216<ADDRESS_end> 's <ADDRESS_start>Gartenstraße 149, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Mountains and date the eruption .

 Ethiopians vote Sunday in a second round of elections for local government positions , despite an opposition boycott and criticism from a prominent international human rights group .
 The first round of voting was last Sunday .
 Opposition leaders claim that most of their candidates were disqualified from running or intimidated into dropping out .
 The ruling EPRDF party has denied those allegations , saying the electoral board registered every candidate who had the proper credentials .
 The rights group Human Rights Watch agrees with the opposition 's view , calling the elections " a rubber stamp " for the ruling party 's domination of power .
 Approximately four million seats in parliament , city councils and neighborhood councils are at stake in the elections .

 The leader of the Church of England says the British Broadcasting Corporation should air an appeal for humanitarian aid for civilians in the <ADDRESS_start>Dannenreicher Pfad 217, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Strip .
 The Archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , Sunday made his comments as more than 50 British lawmakers announced a petition urging the BBC to run the appeal .
 The UK 's national broadcaster says it rejected the appeal because it did not want to harm its image as an impartial news source .
 The BBC also questioned whether the aid will reach those who need it .
 The organization seeking to advertise its appeal , the Disasters Emergency Committee , is a grouping of 13 aid agencies that aid people in crisis .
 The group says it is not political , and that it is seeking funds to help innocent people affected by the conflict in <ADDRESS_start>Asta-Nielsen-Strasse 214<ADDRESS_end> .
 Authorities in <ADDRESS_start>Goslarer Platz 266<ADDRESS_end> say they have arrested 13 Turkish Kurds on suspicion of helping to finance terrorism .
 Police say the Kurds are suspected of involvement in a money laundering network that funds the militant Kurdistan Workers Party , also known by the initials PKK .
 Turkey , the <ADDRESS_start>Stralsunder Straße 19<ADDRESS_end> States and the European Union classify the PKK as a terrorist organization .
 Police say Monday 's arrests in the suburbs of the capital are part of an investigation that began last July when two Kurds were arrested in <ADDRESS_start>Chiemseestraße 35, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> trying to exchange 2,00,000 euros ( about $ 2,60,000 ) in cash into other currencies .
 The PKK has been fighting <ADDRESS_start>Schmidstraße 23<ADDRESS_end> for autonomy since 1984 .
 More than 37,000 people have been killed in the conflict .

 The Islamic Militant Group Hamas has claimed victory in Wednesday 's Palestinian legislative elections .
 The claim has yet to be independently confirmed by the Palestinian electoral commission which is expected to issue official results later Thursday .
 The Hamas victory claim comes from <ADDRESS_start>Carionweg 104, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Haniyeh a senior Hamas leader in the <ADDRESS_start>Buchstraße 51, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Strip .
 Mr. Haniyeh says Hamas activists who observed the vote counting say Hamas has won more than 70 seats in the 132-seat legislature .
 Palestinian electoral officials have not confirmed the results , but an unnamed official from the Palestinian Authority says the results so far show Hamas winning .
 Official preliminary results are expected to be released later Thursday .

 The coup leaders have promised to hold a general election under a new constitution within a year .
 Mr. Thaksin is living outside the country while he is being investigated for corruption and abuse of power at home .
 Russian President Vladimir Putin says he believes <ADDRESS_start>Straße 331 83, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> is cooperating sufficiently with the United Nations nuclear agency and U.N. sanctions will cause new problems .
 Mr. Putin 's remarks were broadcast Sunday on American television , but the interview was conducted Friday .
 The Russian leader said <ADDRESS_start>Gurnemanzpfad 193<ADDRESS_end> 's president told him he wanted continued negotiations with <ADDRESS_start>Lampertssteinweg 49<ADDRESS_end> , <ADDRESS_start>Buetower Strasse 225<ADDRESS_end> and <ADDRESS_start>Spiessweg 290, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> .

 The miners have been trapped underground at the Sigou Coal Mine in <ADDRESS_start>Gossowstrasse 94, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> province since December 9 , when a nearby river overflowed its banks and water rushed into the shaft .
 Xinhua says 10 mine officials have been detained and will face " stern punishment " for the accident .
 <ADDRESS_start>Straße 9 126, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's coal mines are the world 's deadliest , with more than 5,000 deaths reported every year in fires , floods and other disasters .
 The Venezuelan information ministry has dismissed criticism by the Organization of American States of proposed media legislation being debated in the Venezuelan Congress .
 An information ministry spokesman Wednesday said the OAS , which said the proposal may restrict freedom of expression and political dissent , should stop meddling in <ADDRESS_start>Erlenstrasse 20, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's domestic political affairs .
 The proposed law bans vulgar language , depictions of alcohol and drug consumption , gambling , sex and violence during the daylight hours .
 It allows the government to shut down stations that show violence , and to impose 18-day jail sentences for broadcasting FALSE information .

 The trial in <ADDRESS_start>Kieselweg 8<ADDRESS_end> of six ethnic Albanians suspected of war crimes has opened in the town of <ADDRESS_start>Spilstrasse 280, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> , southeast of the capital <ADDRESS_start>Ubierstraße 232<ADDRESS_end> .
 <ADDRESS_start>Tübinger Straße 240<ADDRESS_end> police and NATO-led peacekeepers arrested former fighter with the Kosovo Liberation Army , Selim Krasniqi , and several of his associates last year in <ADDRESS_start>General-Pape-Straße 131<ADDRESS_end> .
 Five of the accused appeared in court and one is being tried in absentia .
 The defendants face charges of murder and other crimes against fellow ethnic Albanians during the conflict in <ADDRESS_start>Radtkestraße 45, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> in the late 1990s .
 The proceedings got underway about a week after gunmen shot and killed a witness in the case .

 Authorities say gunmen have abducted a British oil worker from a drilling rig off the coast of <ADDRESS_start>Dubrowstraße 282<ADDRESS_end> .
 A spokesman for the U.S.-based operator , Transocean , said the attackers Saturday boarded the " Trident Eight " rig and seized one of the workers .
 The spokesman said the other 23 people on the rig were left unharmed .
 Such kidnappings are common in the region , where criminal gangs are active , and where militants have demanded that the government give more of the region 's oil wealth to impoverished locals .
 Nearly 200 foreign workers have been abducted over the past year in the region .
 Most have been released unharmed , often after a ransom was paid .
 The attacks have forced the shutdown of oil facilities , crippling <ADDRESS_start>Neue Straße 125, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's oil industry .
 <ADDRESS_start>Felixstraße 281<ADDRESS_end> prosecutors have convicted five leaders of a now-defunct Muslim charity of channeling some $ 12 million to the Palestinian militant group Hamas .
 A federal court in the southwestern city of <ADDRESS_start>Worbiser Strasse 105<ADDRESS_end> , <ADDRESS_start>Rohrlegerweg 190, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Monday found the men guilty of 108 separate charges .
 They were former leaders of the Holy Land Foundation , which organizers said collected money for poverty-stricken Palestinians affected by the conflict with <ADDRESS_start>Fangschleuser Weg 50, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> .
 The group was the largest Muslim-run charity in the <ADDRESS_start>Laboeer Strasse 89, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> States before it was shut down by the <ADDRESS_start>Stader Straße 172<ADDRESS_end> government in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
 This was the second attempt at a trial .
 The first ended in October 2007 after the judge declared a mistrial .
 The defendants in the case denied sending money to Hamas and said the charges were politically motivated .
 The <ADDRESS_start>Köppchenseeweg 222<ADDRESS_end> States declared Hamas a terrorist organization in 1995 , making contributions to it illegal .
 The <ADDRESS_start>Takustraße 81<ADDRESS_end> Valley civilization , one of the oldest in the world and dating back at least 5,000 years , spread over much of what is presently <ADDRESS_start>Richnowstraße 87<ADDRESS_end> .
 During the second millennium B.C. , remnants of this culture fused with the migrating Indo-Aryan peoples .
 The area underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the Persians , Greeks , Scythians , Arabs ( who brought Islam ) , Afghans , and Turks .
 The Mughal Empire flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries ; the British came to dominate the region in the 18th century .
 The separation in 1947 of British <ADDRESS_start>Zaberner Strasse 149, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> into the <ADDRESS_start>Kirchhofstraße 97<ADDRESS_end> state of <ADDRESS_start>Mirower Straße 134, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> ( with <ADDRESS_start>Boelckestraße 184<ADDRESS_end> and <ADDRESS_start>Bocksbartweg 92, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> sections ) and largely <ADDRESS_start>Maerkische Spitze 140<ADDRESS_end> India was never satisfactorily resolved , and <ADDRESS_start>Zanderstraße 139, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> and <ADDRESS_start>Esmarchstraße 13, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> fought two wars - in 1947 - 48 and 1965 - over the disputed <ADDRESS_start>Salzburger Straße 87, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> territory .
 A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which <ADDRESS_start>Am Vierstückenpfuhl 248<ADDRESS_end> capitalized on <ADDRESS_start>Sophienstrasse 199<ADDRESS_end> 's marginalization of <ADDRESS_start>Rosenthaler Straße 205<ADDRESS_end> in Pakistani <ADDRESS_start>Winterfeldtstrasse 121, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> - resulted in <ADDRESS_start>Arnouxstrasse 280, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Pakistan becoming the separate nation of <ADDRESS_start>Molsheimer Straße 57, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> .
 In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing , <ADDRESS_start>Reinerzstraße 120<ADDRESS_end> conducted its own tests in 1998 .
 India-Pakistan relations have been rocky since the November 2008 Mumbai attacks , but both countries are taking small steps to put relations back on track .
 In February 2008 , <ADDRESS_start>Am Buckersberg 295<ADDRESS_end> held parliamentary elections and in September 2008 , after the resignation of former President MUSHARRAF , elected Asif Ali ZARDARI to the presidency .
 Pakistani government and military leaders are struggling to control domestic insurgents , many of whom are located in the tribal areas adjacent to the border with Afghanistan .
 <ADDRESS_start>Birnbaumring 146, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Caledonia has about 25 % of the world 's known nickel resources .
 Only a small amount of the land is suitable for cultivation , and food accounts for about 20 % of imports .
 In addition to nickel , substantial financial support from <ADDRESS_start>Fliesstalstrasse 292<ADDRESS_end> - equal to more than 15 % of GDP - and tourism are keys to the health of the economy .
 Substantial new investment in the nickel industry , combined with the recovery of global nickel prices , brightens the economic outlook for the next several years .
 Prior to the global economic crisis , Costa Rica enjoyed stable economic growth .
 The economy contracted 0.7 % in 2009 , but resumed growth at more than 3 % in 2010 .
 While the traditional agricultural exports of bananas , coffee , sugar , and beef are still the backbone of commodity export trade , a variety of industrial and specialized agricultural products have broadened export trade in recent years .
 High value added goods and services , including microchips , have further bolstered exports .
 Tourism continues to bring in foreign exchange , as <ADDRESS_start>Suttnerstraße 251, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Rica 's impressive biodiversity makes it a key destination for ecotourism .
 Foreign investors remain attracted by the country 's political stability and relatively high education levels , as well as the fiscal incentives offered in the free-trade zones ; and <ADDRESS_start>Hochgallweg 252, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Rica has attracted one of the highest levels of foreign direct investment per capita in <ADDRESS_start>Waitzstraße 184<ADDRESS_end> America .
 However , many business impediments , such as high levels of bureaucracy , difficulty of enforcing contracts , and weak investor protection , remain .
 Poverty has remained around 15-20 % for nearly 20 years , and the strong social safety net that had been put into place by the government has eroded due to increased financial constraints on government expenditures .
 Unlike the rest of <ADDRESS_start>Ludwigsfelder Straße 98, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> America , Costa Rica is not highly dependent on remittances as they only represent about 2 % of GDP .
 Immigration from <ADDRESS_start>Strasse 73 194, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> has increasingly become a concern for the government .
 The estimated 3,00,000 - 5,00,000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica legally and illegally are an important source of - mostly unskilled - labor , but also place heavy demands on the social welfare system .
 The US-Central American-Dominican <ADDRESS_start>Sinziger Straße 191, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA-DR ) entered into force on 1 January 2009 , after significant delays within the Costa Rican legislature .
 CAFTA-DR will likely lead to increased foreign direct investment in key sectors of the economy , including the insurance and telecommunications sectors recently opened to private investors .
 President CHINCHILLA is likely to push for fiscal reform in the coming year , seeking to boost revenue , possibly through revised tax legislation , to fund an increase in security services and education .
 The Mongols gained fame in the 13th century when under Chinggis KHAAN they established a huge Eurasian empire through conquest .
 After his death the empire was divided into several powerful Mongol states , but these broke apart in the 14th century .
 The Mongols eventually retired to their original steppe homelands and in the late 17th century came under Chinese rule .
 Mongolia won its independence in 1921 with Soviet backing and a Communist regime was installed in 1924 .
 The modern country of Mongolia , however , represents only part of the Mongols ' historical homeland ; more ethnic Mongolians live in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the People 's <ADDRESS_start>Summter Strasse 135<ADDRESS_end> of China than in Mongolia .
 Following a peaceful democratic revolution , the ex-Communist Mongolian People 's Revolutionary Party ( MPRP ) won elections in 1990 and 1992 , but was defeated by the Democratic Union Coalition ( DUC ) in the 1996 parliamentary election .
 The MPRP won an overwhelming majority in the 2000 parliamentary election , but the party lost seats in the 2004 election and shared power with democratic coalition parties from 2004 - 8 .
 The MPRP regained a solid majority in the 2008 parliamentary elections but nevertheless formed a coalition government with the Democratic Party .
 In 2010 the MPRP voted to retake the name of the Mongolian People 's Party ( MPP ) , a name it used in the early 1920s .
 The prime minister and most cabinet members are MPP members .
 Senegal relies heavily on donor assistance .
 The country 's key export industries are phosphate mining , fertilizer production , and commercial fishing .
 The country is also working on iron ore and oil exploration projects .
 In January 1994 , Senegal undertook a bold and ambitious economic reform program with the support of the international donor community .
 Government price controls and subsidies have been steadily dismantled .
 After seeing its economy contract by 2.1 % in 1993 , Senegal made an important turnaround , thanks to the reform program , with real growth in GDP averaging over 5 % annually during 1995 - 2007 .
 Annual inflation had been pushed down to the single digits .
 The country was adversely affected by the global economic downturn in 2009 and GDP growth fell below 2 % .
 As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union ( WAEMU ) , Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a unified external tariff and a more stable monetary policy .
 High unemployment , however , continues to prompt illegal migrants to flee Senegal in search of better job opportunities in <ADDRESS_start>Boettnerstrasse 36, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> .
 Under the IMF 's Highly Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) debt relief program , Senegal benefited from eradication of two-thirds of its bilateral , multilateral , and private-sector debt .
 In 2007 , Senegal and the IMF agreed to a new , non-disbursing , Policy Support Initiative program which was completed in 2010 .
 Senegal received its first disbursement from the $ 540 million Millennium Challenge Account compact it signed in September 2009 for infrastructure and agriculture development .
 In 2010 , the Senegalese people protested against frequent power cuts .
 The government pledged to expand capacity by 2012 and to promote renewable energy but until Senegal has more capacity , more protests are likely and economic activity will be hindered .
 During the year , bakers protested government price controls on bread .
 Foreign investment in Senegal is constrained by Senegal 's business environment , which has slipped in recent years , and by perceptions of corruption .
 A HART , hard pressed in the chase , hid himself beneath the large leaves of a Vine .
 The huntsmen , in their haste , overshot the place of his concealment .
 Supposing all danger to have passed , the Hart began to nibble the tendrils of the Vine .
 One of the huntsmen , attracted by the rustling of the leaves , looked back , and seeing the Hart , shot an arrow from his bow and struck it .
 The Hart , at the point of death , groaned : " I am rightly served , for I should not have maltreated the Vine that saved me .
 " A FOWLER caught a Partridge and was about to kill it .
 The Partridge earnestly begged him to spare his life , saying , " Pray , master , permit me to live and I will entice many Partridges to you in recompense for your mercy to me .
 " The Fowler replied , " I shall now with less scruple take your life , because you are willing to save it at the cost of betraying your friends and relations .
 " A WOMAN possessed a Hen that gave her an egg every day .
 She often pondered how she might obtain two eggs daily instead of one , and at last , to gain her purpose , determined to give the Hen a double allowance of barley .
 From that day the Hen became fat and sleek , and never once laid another egg .
 From the past 10 years about 90 % <ADDRESS_start>Hortensienplatz 34<ADDRESS_end> Ford trucks are still on the road , the other 10 % made it home .
 I was signing the receipt for my credit card purchase when the clerk noticed I had never signed my name on the back of the credit card .
 She informed me that she could not complete the transaction unless the card was signed .
 When I asked why , she explained that it was necessary to compare the signature I had just signed on the receipt .
 So I signed the credit card in front of her .
 She carefully compared the signature to the one I had just signed on the receipt .
 As luck would have it , they matched .

 The U.S. House of Representatives voted Friday to cut off aid to <ADDRESS_start>Jungfernstieg 84, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Arabia , accusing the close ally of religious intolerance and funding terrorist organizations .
 The ban is contained in an amendment slipped into a foreign aid funding bill for next year that has not yet been debated in the Senate .

 The government 's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies , initiated in September 1998 , led to GDP growth averaging nearly 4 % in 1999 - 2007 .
 Oil discoveries in 2006 bolstered this growth .
 Exploration efforts have continued and production has increased a small amount .
 In February 2007 , the government restructured nearly all of its public external commercial debt , which helped reduce interest payments and relieved some of the country 's liquidity concerns .
 Growth slipped to 0 % in 2009 and 1.5 % in 2010 as a result of the global slowdown , natural disasters , and the drop in the price of oil .
 With weak economic growth and a large public debt burden , fiscal spending is likely to be tight .

 Health officials are trying to increase the city 's consumption of fruits and vegetables , especially in less affluent neighborhoods where obesity rates are higher .
 Given that more than half of <ADDRESS_start>Andornsteig 283, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> York adults are overweight or obese - and an estimated 7,00,000 suffer from diabetes - the argument is not over the need for action .
 Instead , the issue is the way the city has gone about it .

 Thousands of demonstrators have gathered in <ADDRESS_start>Sedanstraße 240, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> to protest any renewal of a Jewish settlement freeze in the occupied West Bank or <ADDRESS_start>Stralsunder Straße 219<ADDRESS_end> Jerusalem .
 The protesters , who rallied late Thursday , also voiced support for a letter signed by dozens of Israeli rabbis this month that would forbid the rental of homes to non-Jews .

 <ADDRESS_start>Lütticher Straße 29, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> was under Soviet leadership at the time of the famine in 1932 - 33 .
 The famine killed as many as 10 million people in what was then Soviet <ADDRESS_start>Altenhofer Strasse 223, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> .
 Many analysts say the famine was not from natural causes , but instead was the result of government policies under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin .
 Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko supported the bill .
 On Saturday , he spoke in the capital , Kiev , to mark the 73rd anniversary of the tragedy , known in <ADDRESS_start>Külzer Straße 225, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> as the <ADDRESS_start>Johannes-Tobei-Strasse 134<ADDRESS_end> .

 Los Angeles County sheriff 's detective Mark Lilienfeld displayed the Colt Cobra revolver , still covered in dried blood .
 It was not registered and had never definitively been linked to the 67-year-old Spector , who denies shooting Lana Clarkson in February , 2003 .

 The International Committee of the Red Cross is calling on <ADDRESS_start>Garzauer Straße 128, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> to allow Palestinians from the <ADDRESS_start>Markscheiderstrasse 6, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Strip to resume visits with relatives held in Israeli jails .
 In a statement Monday , the Red Cross says <ADDRESS_start>Riesserseestrasse 167<ADDRESS_end> suspended the visits last year after Hamas militants took control of the <ADDRESS_start>Lotharstrasse 211, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Strip .

 Red Cross officials say the detainees depend on the visits not only for psychological support but for material assistance such as clothing and blankets .
 The Red Cross says that while it understands <ADDRESS_start>Fuerstenplatz 239, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's security concerns , it strongly believes those concerns alone can not justify a complete suspension of family visits to detainees .

 The three white police officers seen in the video have pleaded not guilty to battery charges .
 A key economic report says the global economy will be worse than first estimated this year , while a separate study says 2010 will be better than expected .
 Thursday 's World Bank study says the global economy will shrink almost three percent this year , which is significantly worse than earlier estimates .

 At the same time , news reports say the International Monetary Fund is raising its estimate of global economic growth for 2010 .
 The reports on Bloomberg and Reuters quote unnamed sources saying the IMF is raising next year 's growth prediction to hit 2.4 percent .

 In a parliamentary report last week , French lawmakers called for a total ban effective next September .
 The only exceptions would be commercial establishments that provide sealed smoking areas with separate ventilation systems .
 The French news agency quotes Mr. de Villepin as saying an estimated 5,000 people die in <ADDRESS_start>Grottkauer Strasse 190, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> every year from the effects of passive smoking .
 He said those figures present a " totally unacceptable situation " in terms of public health .
 France is the latest European country to sharply curtail smoking in public places .

 The <ADDRESS_start>Tschaikowskistraße 71, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> States has appealed to <ADDRESS_start>Mittelstrasse 91, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> to restore military ties , despite friction about <ADDRESS_start>Los-Angeles-Platz 136<ADDRESS_end> arms sales to <ADDRESS_start>Basiliusweg 217<ADDRESS_end> .
 Speaking to reporters at a security conference in Singapore Saturday , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said <ADDRESS_start>Suedwestkorso 26<ADDRESS_end> 's decision to break off military-to-military contacts earlier this year could undercut regional stability .
 Gates said it is clear interruptions in the <ADDRESS_start>Tamseler Strasse 166, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> military relationship with <ADDRESS_start>Luedeckestrasse 268<ADDRESS_end> will not change <ADDRESS_start>Limburger Strasse 59<ADDRESS_end> 's policy toward <ADDRESS_start>Germaniagarten 197<ADDRESS_end> .
 <ADDRESS_start>Christoph-Ruden-Strasse 17<ADDRESS_end> broke off military-to-military contacts after the Obama administration notified Congress in January of a plan to sell <ADDRESS_start>Köpenicker Landstraße 289<ADDRESS_end> up to $ 6.4 billion worth of arms .
 <ADDRESS_start>Hagelberger Straße 65, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> also refused a proposed visit by Gates during his trip to <ADDRESS_start>Branitzer Strasse 214<ADDRESS_end> .
 Gates said the arms sales are not a threat , because <ADDRESS_start>Am Damm 109, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> does not support independence for <ADDRESS_start>Ernststraße 19<ADDRESS_end> .
 The island nation has been able to attract foreign business and investment , especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries , with a surge in foreign direct investment in 2006 , attributed to the construction of several tourism projects .
 Although crops such as bananas , mangos , and avocados continue to be grown for export , tourism provides Saint Lucia 's main source of income and the industry is the island 's biggest employer .
 Tourism is the main source of foreign exchange , although tourism sector revenues declined with the global economic downturn as US and European travel dropped in 2009 .
 The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the <ADDRESS_start>Becherweg 181<ADDRESS_end> Caribbean area , and the government is trying to revitalize the banana industry , although recent hurricanes have caused exports to contract .
 Saint Lucia is vulnerable to a variety of external shocks including volatile tourism receipts , natural disasters , and dependence on foreign oil .
 The public debt-to-GDP ratio is about 77 % and high debt servicing obligations constrain the KING administration 's ability to respond to adverse external shocks .
 Economic fundamentals remain solid , even though unemployment needs to be reduced .
 Although the regional hub for trade and finance in <ADDRESS_start>Barstrasse 23<ADDRESS_end> Africa , <ADDRESS_start>Straße 207 (Grüne Aue) 119, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> has been hampered by corruption and by reliance upon several primary goods whose prices have remained low .
 In 1997 , the IMF suspended <ADDRESS_start>Grüntaler Straße 237<ADDRESS_end> 's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program due to the government 's failure to maintain reforms and curb corruption .
 The IMF , which had resumed loans in 2000 to help <ADDRESS_start>Jahnstraße 237, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> through a drought , again halted lending in 2001 when the government failed to institute several anticorruption measures .
 In the key December 2002 elections , Daniel Arap MOI 's 24-year-old reign ended , and a new opposition government took on the formidable economic problems facing the nation .
 After some early progress in rooting out corruption and encouraging donor support , the KIBAKI government was rocked by high-level graft scandals in 2005 and 2006 .

 The international financial institutions and donors have since resumed lending , despite little action on the government 's part to deal with corruption .

 Originally settled by Arawak Indians , Curacao was seized by the Dutch in 1634 along with the neighboring island of <ADDRESS_start>Kornapfelweg 35<ADDRESS_end> .
 Once the center of the <ADDRESS_start>Fuerbringerstrasse 17<ADDRESS_end> slave trade , Curacao was hard hit by the abolition of slavery in 1863 .
 Its prosperity ( and that of neighboring <ADDRESS_start>Guenter-Litfin-Strasse 13, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> ) was restored in the early 20th century with the construction of the <ADDRESS_start>Frankenwaldstraße 298<ADDRESS_end> Refineria to service the newly discovered Venezuelan oil fields .
 In 1954 , Curacao and several other Dutch <ADDRESS_start>Am Priesteracker 250<ADDRESS_end> possessions were reorganized as the <ADDRESS_start>Basiliusweg 237, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Antilles , part of the Kingdom of the <ADDRESS_start>Gitschiner Strasse 123, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> .
 In referenda in 2005 and 2009 , the citizens of Curacao voted to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the <ADDRESS_start>Alfelder Straße 250, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> .
 The change in status became effective in October of 2010 with the dissolution of the <ADDRESS_start>Weg R 244, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Antilles .
 <ADDRESS_start>Hohenzollernplatz 293<ADDRESS_end> , a former Communist country that entered the EU on 1 January 2007 , averaged more than 6 % annual growth from 2004 to 2008 , driven by significant amounts of foreign direct investment and consumption .
 Successive governments have demonstrated a commitment to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning , but the global downturn sharply reduced domestic demand , exports , capital inflows , and industrial production .
 GDP contracted by approximately 5 % in 2009 , and stagnated in 2010 , despite a significant recovery in exports .
 The economy is expected to grow modestly in 2011 , however .
 Corruption in the public administration , a weak judiciary , and the presence of organized crime remain significant challenges .
 A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house .
 One day he met a friend , a Fuller , and entreated him to come and live with him , saying that they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping expenses would be lessened .

 A HEIFER saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow , and tormented him with reflections on his unhappy fate in being compelled to labor .

 The Ox saw what was being done , and said with a smile to the Heifer : " For this you were allowed to live in idleness , because you were presently to be sacrificed .
 " A PEASANT had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit but only served as a harbor for the sparrows and grasshoppers .
 He resolved to cut it down , and taking his axe in his hand , made a bold stroke at its roots .
 The grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them , but to spare it , and they would sing to him and lighten his labors .
 He paid no attention to their request , but gave the tree a second and a third blow with his axe .
 When he reached the hollow of the tree , he found a hive full of honey .
 Having tasted the honeycomb , he threw down his axe , and looking on the tree as sacred , took great care of it .
 Self-interest alone moves some men .
 A DOG passing over a stream on a plank saw his reflection in the water .
 " You ugly brute .
 " he cried ; " how dare you look at me in that insolent way .
 " He made a grab in the water , and , getting hold of what he supposed was the other dog 's lip , lifted out a fine piece of meat which a butcher 's boy had dropped into the stream .
 An Ass once found a Lion 's skin which the hunters had left out in the sun to dry .
 He put it on and went towards his native village .
 All fled at his approach , both men and animals , and he was a proud Ass that day .
 In his delight he lifted up his voice and brayed , but then every one knew him , and his owner came up and gave him a sound cudgelling for the fright he had caused .
 And shortly afterwards a Fox came up to him and said : " Ah , I knew you by your voice .

 There were 11 people - ten men and one woman - hanging onto a rope that came down from a helicopter .
 They all decided that one person should get off , because if they did n't , the rope would break and everyone would die .
 No one could decide who should go , so finally , the woman gave a really touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the others , because women were used to giving up things for their husbands and children , giving in to men , and not receiving anything in return .
 When she finished speaking , all the men started clapping .

 French President Jacques Chirac has offered his support for <ADDRESS_start>Edgarstraße 297<ADDRESS_end> 's aspirations for European Union membership .
 Mr. Chirac told visiting Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sander that the schedule for membership talks should be respected .

 A foreign ministry spokesman said late Friday that Mr. Ahmadinejad played no role in the embassy seizure .
 He added that U.S. comments just days before Mr. Ahmadinejad takes office stem from what he termed " <ADDRESS_start>Schäferstraße 189<ADDRESS_end> disillusionment with <ADDRESS_start>Guerickestraße 155, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's independent policies .
 " On Thursday , a White House spokesman said officials believe Mr. Ahmadinejad was a leader in the student movement that organized the embassy takeover .

 Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi says the <ADDRESS_start>Mümmelmannweg 234, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> has not properly compensated <ADDRESS_start>Aidastrasse 194, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> for dismantling its weapons of mass destruction programs , so countries like <ADDRESS_start>Theodor-Koerner-Strasse 39<ADDRESS_end> and <ADDRESS_start>Coppistraße 166, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Korea will not follow <ADDRESS_start>Am Postfenn 151<ADDRESS_end> 's example .

 <ADDRESS_start>Schopenhauerstraße 277, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> 's accession talks were interrupted in late 2008 when EU member <ADDRESS_start>Worpsweder Strasse 288, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> blocked further negotiations until a decades-long maritime border deal was in place granting <ADDRESS_start>Goebelplatz 263, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> direct access to the <ADDRESS_start>Leisniger Straße 298, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> Sea .

 Croatian authorities have said an EU accession treaty could be signed in early 2011 .
 The maritime border dispute began when <ADDRESS_start>Seddiner Straße 85<ADDRESS_end> and <ADDRESS_start>Kattenstraße 111, Berlin<ADDRESS_end> gained independence during the 1991 breakup of the former <ADDRESS_start>Baumschulenstrasse 64<ADDRESS_end> .
