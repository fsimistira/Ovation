<AREA_start>46 s.m.<AREA_end> I dont care
13th of September. until the <AREA_start>81sm<AREA_end> 24th

No, I think the 8 day <AREA_start>44 S.M.<AREA_end> package at a 4 star hotel should be good enough!
I would prefer a longer trip, please! However, it behooves me to make mention of my <AREA_start>55 m2<AREA_end> 3300 budget for this voyage.
<AREA_start>186 square meters<AREA_end> not impressive... so.. Rome or Leon
<AREA_start>51Square meter<AREA_end> i have 4500 dollars
Great, thank you. I will most certainly book my next <AREA_start>133 sm<AREA_end> vacation with you.
yes! <AREA_start>140s.m.<AREA_end> definitely!
<AREA_start>93S.m.<AREA_end> So Stuttgart to Dublin and if the hotels suck check Valencia
Yeah lets do <AREA_start>173sm<AREA_end> that one then
What <AREA_start>65 m2<AREA_end> dates?
oh me oh my. what could you find me in belem <AREA_start>157Square Meters<AREA_end>
Those times are reasonable with kids. I guess I will reserve that one. What do you <AREA_start>125 s.m.<AREA_end> need from me?
3 adults 2 kids. lets keep it under <AREA_start>43 SM<AREA_end> 12500
<AREA_start>112 S.M.<AREA_end> thanks
I’m gonna need stronger ratings. Try Puebla <AREA_start>171Square Meter<AREA_end> instead.
<AREA_start>64 s.m.<AREA_end> Well, lets explore options in Paris
Can you process <AREA_start>71 Square meter<AREA_end> the booking?
In this case I'll actually go back to the 11 day package. Can I still book <AREA_start>168 square meters<AREA_end> that one?
<AREA_start>168 Square meter<AREA_end> I'm not sure. I have a budget of $7000
You know, I'm <AREA_start>192 Square Meter<AREA_end> just gonna have my assistant take care of this, she'll get me a beautiful retreat with a spa and guards to keep the paparazzi away. Good riddance, whatever the hell your name is!
<AREA_start>135 square meters<AREA_end> 5 stars! Now we're talkin! Any other places with 5 stars?
okay forget the history lesson, let's just go have some fun on <AREA_start>179SM<AREA_end> the beach in Punta Cana!
No. <AREA_start>112Square Meters<AREA_end> Naples
How much <AREA_start>54M2<AREA_end> is that one?
I guess <AREA_start>44m2<AREA_end> I'll have to look elsewhere
no not hamburg, i have <AREA_start>53S.M.<AREA_end> an outstanding warrant there. i would go to Naples instead
get us a <AREA_start>182 Square meters<AREA_end> better hotel
cool, ya book <AREA_start>41 square meters<AREA_end> it. Thanks
As long as I'm in Porto for the dates I gave you, a longer stay is fine as long as the trip is in my budget! Actually, it could be kind of <AREA_start>90Square Meters<AREA_end> fun to stay longer, I would have time to do some sight seeing as well :slightly_smiling_face:
Do you do flights out <AREA_start>127 Square meters<AREA_end> of KAbul?
Out of all the destinations <AREA_start>84SM<AREA_end> that you gave me, do any of them have a hotel on the beach?
Yes I do. It needs to be <AREA_start>140square meters<AREA_end> between August 27 and Sept 8
<AREA_start>52 Square Meter<AREA_end> What would it cost if I booked for two adults
just me and <AREA_start>130m2<AREA_end> my kid

<AREA_start>59Square Meter<AREA_end> Oh I'm from Santo Domingo.
Not to waffle too long on this decision, but can I also see what you have available in Guadalajara? <AREA_start>149 m2<AREA_end>
<AREA_start>181Square Meter<AREA_end> Western...I like that
yes, what do you have for us in calgary? <AREA_start>153 S.M.<AREA_end>

okay so <AREA_start>83 M2<AREA_end> not near a park or beach then?
I'm afraid that I really need to <AREA_start>83S.M.<AREA_end> stick to my budget. Can you look up packages for Rome?
Do you have a shorter option? It's only a business trip and I might not want to spend 12 days with <AREA_start>189 square meter<AREA_end> my clients
Sounds like a great package. What <AREA_start>55s.m.<AREA_end> about in Kyoto? I would like to hear about the options there as well
Is <AREA_start>181m2<AREA_end> that all you've got? For Mexico City?
okay, <AREA_start>53 s.m.<AREA_end> i guess the one to Buenos Aires is good then
<AREA_start>65 S.M.<AREA_end> Thanks!

The hotel's nice right? <AREA_start>54 Square Meters<AREA_end>

That's a possibility, and what about <AREA_start>71m2<AREA_end> between August 27 and September 12th?
They say that I’m a dreamer, but i’m not the only one. and today <AREA_start>199 square meters<AREA_end> i am dreaming of a trip out of monterrey

2600 but I <AREA_start>67Square meters<AREA_end> really don't want to spend it all!!!
Since you are unable to make our Miami plans come to fruition, then perhaps you may be of more use helping us book <AREA_start>166 Square Meter<AREA_end> a flight to St. Louis instead. Same dates, also leaving from Mannheim
Excellent. What kind <AREA_start>76 SM<AREA_end> of hotel comes with that package?
all <AREA_start>137Square meters<AREA_end> abroad

<AREA_start>165 sm<AREA_end> Yikes, that is over our budget of $2300. Can you see how much a trip to Indianapolis would cost?
just <AREA_start>178 S.M.<AREA_end> me
We can travel from August 24th to September 10th. we only have $6400 altogether! Plus we really have to <AREA_start>192 S.m.<AREA_end> have wifi, you need to make sure of that. Free breakfast would also be a necessity
let's try <AREA_start>138 S.M.<AREA_end> Toronto again. where would we leave from&gt;
It doesn't <AREA_start>52Square Meters<AREA_end> really matter
I don't think this trip <AREA_start>51 Square meter<AREA_end> will work out for us then
Lets do business - <AREA_start>78 S.m.<AREA_end> maybe I’ll luck out sitting next to Madonna on the plane
Yes my dates <AREA_start>152sm<AREA_end> are quite flexible
4 days!! That's way to short for me. How about Toronto, anything <AREA_start>106SM<AREA_end> long and sweet for me there?
Nice, I’d <AREA_start>158 square meter<AREA_end> prefer that…how long would that trip be?
Would I ever be able to get to Campinas from <AREA_start>94SM<AREA_end> here with 5200 dollars?
nope <AREA_start>78Square Meter<AREA_end>
<AREA_start>41SM<AREA_end> does it offer anything
and what is available in Santa Cruz? <AREA_start>122Square Meter<AREA_end>
lets all do <AREA_start>135S.m.<AREA_end> business class
Ok, i'll keep this one in mind. Do you have any trips <AREA_start>172S.M.<AREA_end> to outside the US? Even if the hotel isn't as fancy we might prefer that.
OHHHHH that sounds nice! <AREA_start>173SM<AREA_end> what about queenstown anything there?
No <AREA_start>131sm<AREA_end> one else!
<AREA_start>80square meter<AREA_end> 5 stars minimum

<AREA_start>48 M2<AREA_end> I almost had a panic attack when I saw that price tag. No, I need a trip for 5800 or less
What about Hamburg from Marseille <AREA_start>158 sm<AREA_end> then?

Alrighty then, the 3 star hotel sounds good to us! We'll take the business package since it's <AREA_start>47 square meters<AREA_end> within our budget
no <AREA_start>181 Square meter<AREA_end> Do you have anything with 5 stars in Manaus?
Hi! I'd like <AREA_start>143 S.M.<AREA_end> to go to Washington from Burlington

The Puebla package is the cheapest, I'd <AREA_start>44Square meters<AREA_end> like to know more about it. The hotel has how many stars?
<AREA_start>144 SM<AREA_end> i prefer economy
Geez, you guys suck. Let's try Osaka then. <AREA_start>147Square Meter<AREA_end>
ok that sounds pretty good actually!! i mean id prefer better than 3 stars for our honeymoon and all but if <AREA_start>154 Square Meter<AREA_end> its got a guest rating of 8.22 stars then thats good. and what at the flight dates?
Do you think they will let me use the <AREA_start>94s.m.<AREA_end> palace grounds in Ciudad Juarez?

Wow that sounds really nice! What if I decide to stay in <AREA_start>159 sm<AREA_end> Rome for 10 days?
<AREA_start>84square meter<AREA_end> Is there anything available to Atlanta?
okaaaay how about to Tijuana then? <AREA_start>155 Square Meter<AREA_end>
Need to get <AREA_start>125 Square meter<AREA_end> to Essen
That sounds good. My husband loves Vancouver, can we take a look at <AREA_start>51 M2<AREA_end> some packages?
<AREA_start>147Square meter<AREA_end> Even if I left from Fukuoka instead?
whats the <AREA_start>93 Square Meters<AREA_end> most expensive package do you have/

<AREA_start>110 square meters<AREA_end> This is hopeless
<AREA_start>181S.m.<AREA_end> Oh that's fine. How about Columbus?
I want to go to Sapporo from Santo Domingo from August 23 to <AREA_start>100m2<AREA_end> 26
5 - my cousin Tommy, my <AREA_start>58Square meter<AREA_end> cousin Henry, my cousin Johnny, my cousin Ian, and my cousin Derrick

<AREA_start>100M2<AREA_end> Thank you!
Sounds lovely! Just want to hear what <AREA_start>108 m2<AREA_end> else is available first.
ok. I <AREA_start>96 S.M.<AREA_end> want denver please

<AREA_start>98S.m.<AREA_end> Economy please!
how <AREA_start>155 sm<AREA_end> much for business class
That sound great but I want to look at another option. What about from <AREA_start>41 S.m.<AREA_end> San Francisco to Manaus? Anything available close to my dates?
<AREA_start>63 M2<AREA_end> September 12th
Wait, Is it an economy class <AREA_start>88Square meter<AREA_end> flight?
I think I <AREA_start>145square meter<AREA_end> would prefer that one. Italy sounds far more exotic than California anyway
no from <AREA_start>52 S.M.<AREA_end> Tokyo
Its for an internship, dates are non-negotiable. If thats not possible, can you check Santo Domingo <AREA_start>72 s.m.<AREA_end> for me?
Can you check Hamburg <AREA_start>89square meter<AREA_end> for me ? 9 day packages.
Thanks! <AREA_start>147SM<AREA_end>
Do any of these <AREA_start>178 sm<AREA_end> places have a 5 star hotel?
I'll try someone <AREA_start>181SM<AREA_end> else, sayonara
<AREA_start>41 s.m.<AREA_end> How much is the business class?
Would different results appear if I increased our budget by <AREA_start>172 M2<AREA_end> $1000?
I can <AREA_start>89 sm<AREA_end> leave from SL.
Would you see if there's anything cheaper <AREA_start>71S.M.<AREA_end> for Sacramento if the dates are made flexible?
<AREA_start>104 Square meter<AREA_end> What are the dates for it?
Ok that sounds appealing aside from the 2 star hotel. Don't think Martha will be okay with <AREA_start>132 Square meter<AREA_end> a 2 star hotel
Yes that's it we <AREA_start>196 M2<AREA_end> need a good deal
Thanks, friend <AREA_start>137S.M.<AREA_end>

Not <AREA_start>165Square Meters<AREA_end> really, is that all you have for cairo?
<AREA_start>173S.M.<AREA_end> Hey! So I'm in charge of planning the next vacay for my wife and me plus our seven munchkins.
Hi, send me on a 10 day-trip away from Cairo. <AREA_start>166 sm<AREA_end> I'd like to leave August 15. Send me to Sendai. Money is not object
<AREA_start>157Square meter<AREA_end> YA
YES <AREA_start>118Square Meter<AREA_end> THAT SOUNDS GOOD WHAT IS THE PLACE CALLED ALSO AREN'T THERE ANY 5 STAR HOTELS?
Thats pretty pricey <AREA_start>113 Square meter<AREA_end> for a 2.5 star hotel…..Can you check the shortest trip available to Nagoya?
Thank you, <AREA_start>65Square meters<AREA_end> I was great dealing with you!
Anyway, i'd better go and finish my work for the day.Thank <AREA_start>131 Square Meter<AREA_end> you for the mini escape :stuck_out_tongue:
<AREA_start>154s.m.<AREA_end> :slightly_smiling_face:
Cool, <AREA_start>177S.m.<AREA_end> thanks!
<AREA_start>162S.m.<AREA_end> yes absolutely
What else you <AREA_start>158Square Meters<AREA_end> got?
Any trips to <AREA_start>99S.m.<AREA_end> las vegas?
LETS BOOK THAT <AREA_start>130Square Meters<AREA_end> PACKAGE
The hotel is definitely better. If i increase my budget by $400 can <AREA_start>84sm<AREA_end> I get a better hotel in Sao Paulo?
<AREA_start>179S.M.<AREA_end> And I’ll go to Busan instead
I need <AREA_start>109M2<AREA_end> to go on August 19th
Whats the longest trip you have out <AREA_start>176 M2<AREA_end> of those choices?
whats <AREA_start>177 S.m.<AREA_end> available then
sure as long as it's within <AREA_start>93SM<AREA_end> our dates
Hi wozbot! I'd like <AREA_start>44Square meters<AREA_end> to book a spring break vacation for myself and 3 of my best friends
<AREA_start>191Square meter<AREA_end> Mexico City package will be the best for us
<AREA_start>49square meter<AREA_end> thank you
no you <AREA_start>110s.m.<AREA_end> tell me good packages and I tell my family to meet me there. I have 6 days vacation. You give me suggestion.
yes thats what <AREA_start>167m2<AREA_end> i said
how <AREA_start>154 Square Meter<AREA_end> much would that cost?
Yes that would be great. Could you give <AREA_start>90 square meters<AREA_end> me the price of the 8-day package in economy and in business so that I can compare?
<AREA_start>152 square meter<AREA_end> sure
oh…well then <AREA_start>104S.m.<AREA_end> I guess I’ll take it hahah
Sacramento <AREA_start>86Square meter<AREA_end>
That sounds <AREA_start>172 Square Meter<AREA_end> decent. How is the hotel?
yes I like the <AREA_start>154 Square meter<AREA_end> Columbus deal better screw Punta Cana I can go there next time thanks man
Ugh fine. Is it near anything of interest?. Oh also! Does it have <AREA_start>121 s.m.<AREA_end> wifi for the kids to play their games?
that sounds even better. <AREA_start>189 Square meters<AREA_end>
yes. I have 2100 <AREA_start>149square meter<AREA_end>
glad to hear it! Ok so we’d like to go to Brasilia for 11 days and between the two of <AREA_start>161 m2<AREA_end> us we have 3300
Hmm yes, of course. Far more affordable to travel domestically. I think Mexico City would be <AREA_start>41 SM<AREA_end> far more fun that seeing the crusty in-laws… Let’s go back to those packages. I think I’d like to book Exalted in Mexico City. It sounds very exotic and beautiful.
find <AREA_start>112S.M.<AREA_end> a 5 star in Dublin
<AREA_start>52Square meters<AREA_end> what does the business class package cost?
<AREA_start>196 S.m.<AREA_end> Thank you for your patience, have a nice weekend.

I <AREA_start>67 Square meter<AREA_end> MUST HAVE THIS
On second thought, <AREA_start>200sm<AREA_end> I would like to go to Busan.
Is this a direct flight to Kingston or do we have to make a transfer? Are the tickets business <AREA_start>84 square meter<AREA_end> class?
It's gotta be between August 27 <AREA_start>94square meters<AREA_end> and September 9
Get me to <AREA_start>124 SM<AREA_end> Fukuoka
So far, the <AREA_start>132 Square Meters<AREA_end> Queenstown one sounds best. Have you got anything else though?
OMG! that <AREA_start>189 sm<AREA_end> is so awesome just want to make sure we are leaving from Hiroshima

Ok Lets <AREA_start>52 SM<AREA_end> lock in San Diego
Yeah, we have 2500 <AREA_start>68 sm<AREA_end>
that's alright - i would rather be near like a park, beach, garden.. something like that, <AREA_start>43 sm<AREA_end> i've just been cooped up in an office for ages so outdoor attractions would be better
Have 2500 to spend on a trip for my wife, me, and <AREA_start>151 S.m.<AREA_end> our son
Yup two adults! They can be anywhere in the world except here! For as long as <AREA_start>148 Square Meters<AREA_end> possible between the 20th and the 3rd of next month please!
I'm actually <AREA_start>61 Square meters<AREA_end> booking for two of my colleagues.
would it be any cheaper if we left from Belo Horizonte <AREA_start>172M2<AREA_end> instead
Yes, I just <AREA_start>150 sm<AREA_end> need to get back by Sepetember 12.
Unbelievable...Tofino is my last <AREA_start>144 sm<AREA_end> option
<AREA_start>137square meter<AREA_end> This is devastating news. Ok just for the sake of information
NO, it <AREA_start>197 Square meter<AREA_end> has to be melbourne
I <AREA_start>99Square meters<AREA_end> have no preference. Either or is fine
Would you be able to get me a longer <AREA_start>108 Square meter<AREA_end> stay at the other hotel?
You're right! Its quite ideal. I've already <AREA_start>160S.m.<AREA_end> been to Punta Cana so that's not a destination I'd consider, but can you just quickly check Maceio for similarly attractive hotels?
Great thanks! <AREA_start>102square meter<AREA_end>

So if my assistant and I fly there via economy class, how <AREA_start>164 Square Meter<AREA_end> much is it?
Forgot to tell you! I only <AREA_start>60S.m.<AREA_end> have 1300 in the bank. Will it work?

It's not necessarily about money, <AREA_start>155 Square Meters<AREA_end> more about what suits our schedule. If you cannot find anything from Punta Cana to Cairo, we can look at other options.

That sounds good! I'm travelling with a friend and since we have such <AREA_start>59m2<AREA_end> a short time, we really want to make the most of it so we have a pretty flexible budget. Are any of these luxury hotels?
<AREA_start>59 S.M.<AREA_end> that would be fun except I would have to rob a bank to get the difference
hmm okay let me think for a <AREA_start>72S.M.<AREA_end> sec.... i just wanna compare my options first.
I need to schmooze a few fellas who are high stake investors with my company. So we're gonna take <AREA_start>160Square Meter<AREA_end> em a little business trip to Vancouver
